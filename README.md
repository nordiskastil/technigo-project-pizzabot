# Pizzabot

Brief description of the assignment
Build a pizzabot with JavaScript using variables and conditionals. 

I started with a simple approach using if and else for the food choice. The code worked but I did not get the right alert, just: You have chosen 1 instead of you have chosen Pizza. I stuggled with this for quit a while and finaly searched help online. I found out that I needed to add parseInt, to convert the user's input into an integer (a number), that worked. 

It was quit a challenging assignment. Thera are stil som issues: I don't understand why name is crossed out. I'm also not always consistent with the quotation marks and semicolon signs. If I had more time I would improve that and maybe try out some more options in JavaScript and make it look more attractive. Since I am only a beginner in JavaScript I will return to the lessons first.
